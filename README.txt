Editeur de graphe is a graph editor created in the order to see dynamically the Dijksra’s algorithm.


INSTALLATION
------------

From the zip :

	just unzip all the files into a directory you want then launch it with 		Eclipse.

From the jar :

	just launch GrapheEditeur.jar


STARTING THE APPLICATION
------------------------

Click in the open space to add a node
Click a first node and an other node to add an edge
Click a node or an edge to select it and show informations about.
Drag from one node to move him.

When a node is selected : change the node color and his edges
When an edge is selected: change the edge color and his nodes

LAUNCHING THE ALGORITHM
—----------------------

To launch the algorithm of Dijkstra, click on the button to launch it and you will see the algorithm on the graph
